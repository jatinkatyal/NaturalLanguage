This repository serves as a portfolio of projects under NLP. Project concepts are inspired by DeepLearning.ai NLP specialization. Project topics are not taken from the specialization, it is just used as a reference for concepts in NLP and create projects different from the ones exercised in the courses.

## Completed
### 1. Training Sentiment Classifier on McDonald's Customer Reviews
